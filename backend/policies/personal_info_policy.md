# Personal Information Update Policy v1.2

## 1. Overview

Employees are responsible for keeping their personal information up to date in the company's HR system. Accurate records are essential for payroll, tax compliance, benefits administration, and emergency contact purposes.

## 2. What Can Be Updated

Employees can update the following information through the OpenHire self-service portal:

Self-service updates (no approval required): Phone number, emergency contact details, communication preferences, and profile photo.

Updates requiring HR review: Legal name, home address, bank account details, and tax withholding information.

Updates requiring documentation: Legal name change (requires legal documentation such as court order or marriage certificate), citizenship or work authorization status changes.

## 3. Address Update Process

To update your home address:

Step 1: Go to the OpenHire portal and navigate to "Profile" or ask the HR chatbot "Update my address."
Step 2: Enter your new address including street, city, state/province, postal code, and country.
Step 3: The system will validate the address format automatically.
Step 4: Once submitted, the following records will be updated automatically: payroll records, tax documentation (W-4 or equivalent), benefits enrollment records, and emergency contact records.
Step 5: You will receive a confirmation email within 24 hours.

Important: Address changes may affect your tax withholding. If you move to a different state or country, please contact HR to review your tax situation.

## 4. Bank Account Changes

For security purposes, bank account changes require additional verification:
- Submit the change request through the portal
- HR will send a verification code to your registered email and phone
- Changes take effect in the next payroll cycle (allow 5 business days)

## 5. Data Privacy

All personal information is stored securely and handled in accordance with GDPR and local data protection regulations. Only authorized HR personnel and the employee's direct manager (for emergency contact info only) have access to personal records.
