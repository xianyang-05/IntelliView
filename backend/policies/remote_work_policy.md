# Remote Work Policy v2.0

## 1. Overview

Our company supports flexible work arrangements to help employees maintain a healthy work-life balance while meeting business objectives. This policy outlines the guidelines for remote work, hybrid work, and working from another country.

## 2. Eligibility

All full-time employees who have completed their probation period (typically 3 months) are eligible to apply for remote work arrangements. Eligibility is subject to role requirements and manager approval.

## 3. Hybrid Work Model

Our default work model is hybrid: employees are expected to be in the office a minimum of 2 days per week (Tuesday and Thursday are designated office days). The remaining days may be worked remotely from the employee's registered home address.

## 4. Full Remote Work

Full remote work arrangements may be approved on a case-by-case basis for roles that do not require physical presence. Full remote employees must maintain availability during core business hours (10:00 AM – 4:00 PM in their local timezone) and attend mandatory in-person events (e.g., quarterly all-hands, team offsites).

## 5. Working from Another Country

Employees wishing to work from another country must obtain prior approval from both their manager and HR. The following conditions apply:

- Maximum duration: 30 consecutive calendar days per request
- Maximum total: 90 days per calendar year
- The employee must ensure they have legal right to work in the destination country (tourist visas may not permit work activities)
- Tax implications: Working from another country for more than 183 days in a calendar year may trigger tax obligations in that country. HR will assess tax implications before approval.
- Time zone: The employee must maintain at least 4 hours of overlap with their team's core working hours
- Equipment and security: The employee must use company-approved VPN and ensure secure internet access

Requests must be submitted at least 2 weeks in advance through the ZeroHR portal.

## 6. Home Office Setup

Employees approved for regular remote work are eligible for a one-time home office stipend of $1,000 to set up their workspace. This covers ergonomic furniture, monitors, keyboards, and other equipment. Additional equipment requests should be directed to IT.

## 7. Communication and Availability

Remote employees must be reachable via Slack and email during core business hours. Video cameras should be turned on during team meetings. Employees must update their Slack status to reflect their availability.
