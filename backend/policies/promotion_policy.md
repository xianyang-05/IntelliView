# Promotion & Career Progression Policy v1.5

## 1. Overview

Our promotion process is designed to be transparent, fair, and merit-based. Promotions are evaluated during two formal review cycles per year: mid-year (June) and end-of-year (December).

## 2. Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for promotion consideration, an employee must meet ALL of the following criteria:

- Minimum of 12 months in their current role at the time of the review cycle
- Performance rating of "Exceeds Expectations" or higher in the most recent performance review
- Completion of all mandatory training and certifications for their current level
- No active performance improvement plans (PIPs) in the past 12 months
- Demonstrated competencies at the next level for at least 6 months (as documented by their manager)

## 3. Promotion Levels

### 3.1 Engineering Track
- Junior Engineer → Engineer: Typically 1–2 years. Must demonstrate independent task completion and code quality.
- Engineer → Senior Engineer: Typically 2–3 years. Must demonstrate technical leadership, mentoring, and cross-team collaboration.
- Senior Engineer → Staff Engineer: Typically 3–4 years. Must demonstrate architectural ownership, org-wide impact, and thought leadership.
- Staff Engineer → Principal Engineer: By nomination only. Must demonstrate company-wide technical strategy and external industry recognition.

### 3.2 Management Track
- Team Lead → Engineering Manager: Must demonstrate people management skills, hiring capability, and team performance improvement.
- Engineering Manager → Senior Engineering Manager: Must demonstrate multi-team leadership and strategic planning.
- Senior Engineering Manager → Director: Must demonstrate department-level strategy and cross-functional leadership.

## 4. Promotion Process

Step 1: Self-Assessment — The employee completes a self-assessment highlighting achievements, impact, and readiness for the next level.

Step 2: Manager Nomination — The employee's direct manager submits a promotion packet including evidence of performance, peer feedback, and a justification narrative.

Step 3: Calibration Committee — A cross-functional calibration committee reviews all nominations to ensure consistency and fairness across the organization.

Step 4: Decision & Communication — Approved promotions are communicated to employees within 2 weeks of the calibration meeting. Promotions take effect on the first day of the following month.

## 5. Compensation Adjustments

Promoted employees receive a salary adjustment of 10–20% depending on the level and market benchmarks. Equity refreshers are also granted at the discretion of the compensation committee. The new compensation takes effect on the same date as the promotion.

## 6. Unsuccessful Nominations

If a promotion nomination is not approved, the employee's manager will provide specific, actionable feedback within 2 weeks. A development plan will be created to address any gaps, and the employee may be re-nominated in the next cycle.
